## My process

### Built with

-Semantic HTML5 markup
-CSS custom properties
-Flexbox
-Responsive card layout
-JavaScript for dynamic data injection from JSON
-JSON file for structured data storage
-Google Fonts (Hanken Grotesk)


### What I learned
-How to fetch and parse JSON and use it to dynamically build UI elements
-Making the UI accessible by adding tabindex="0" so rows are keyboard-focusable
-I also learned how to use GitHub better. Since I had only used it once/twice before, this project helped me get more comfortable with the entire process of pushing code, managing files and updating my README so others can view my work clearly

### Continued development

-Better accessibility features (such as ARIA labels for the score section)
-Adding animations for row hover/focus transitions
-Making the layout fully responsive across larger screen sizes
-Experimenting with hosting JSON externally



### Useful resources

- AI tools: Helped me debug and understand how to use GitHub properly.
-Stack Overflow: Used to look up explanations for JavaScript errors and better understand how fetch() works when pulling in JSON data.
